    The Login button is only designed to work in connection with the JavaScript
    SDK â€” if you're building a mobile app or can't use our JavaScript SDK, you
    should follow the login flow guide for that type of app instead. The
    Continue with Facebook button replaces earlier versions of the Login button.
    For more information, see Migration. Plugin Configurator Width The pixel
    width of the plugin Button Size large Button Text continue_with Button
    Layout Shape default Enable Logout Button Include name and profile picture
    when user is signed into Facebook [?] Get Code Continue as {Name} Button The
    Continue as {Name} button has the text "Continue as {persons' name}" and
    optionally includes the person's Facebook profile picture if they're logged
    in to Facebook in the same browser. To use the Continue as {Name} button,
    you must first load the JavaScript SDK. For instructions on setting up the
    JavaScript SDK, see the JavaScript SDK Quickstart. Enable Continue as {Name}
    by adding data-use-continue-as="true" to the settings for your button. The
    height of the Continue as {Name} button is not customizable. Button Size
    Height Width Custom Widths? Small 20 px 200 px No Medium 28 px 200 - 320 px
    Yes Large 40px 240 - 400 px Yes If the you select a size beyond the maximum
    parameters, the button will default to the maximum width. Best Practices for
    the Continue as {Name} Button The Continue As {Name} button can be a great
    way to increase clicks and engagement. It lets the user see their profile
    picture and name on our Login button and can help make your app feel more
    personalized. As a result, it can also be confusing if the user isn't
    expecting to see their name and profile photo in this context. Please
    consider the following to see if Continue As is best for your app. Even if
    the Continue As {Name} is not right for your app, you can still try the new
    JavaScript SDK buttons that say "Continue With Facebook".
